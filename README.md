# DroughtPropagation
Codes for generating Drought Propagation metrics and figures for article "Human-driven land surface transformations are major influences in global drought propagation"  
Step1 : Convert monthly time series into non-parametric drought indices  
Step2 : Compute start and end of meteorological droughts  
Step3 : Compute the triggered Frequency, Duration and Intensity and overall Vulnerability
